# CourtCounterCopy
For playing around with android studio and git.

## Importing to Android Studio from GitHub
1. Go to File > New > Project from Version Control > GitHub
2. Sign in
3. Choose a project from the dropdown and choose the directory you want to save it to

## Verifying that the project works
1. Upon opening the project, go to the left pane and open up the Project view
2. in Project View, go to CourtCounterCopy/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml. activity_main.xml is the primary view that starts up when the app launches.
3. If you get an error on the first few lines, where android is being imported, follow these instructions:
